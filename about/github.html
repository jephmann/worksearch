            <h2>A work in progress; a personal, independent project.</h2>
            <p>
                WorkSeach is a working title of a personal web project which I
                am currently building for myself as a jobseeker for the intent
                of managing my contacts and logging my activities.
                Among other things, it is a PHP/MySQL project using PDO (instead
                of mysql_connect or mysqli_connect) to connect PHP to MySQL.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the most part I am using this project to work on some of my
                weak or rusty spots as a coder and thus stay active during my
                own job search.
                (No, I'm not going to state what my weak or rusty spots are --
                not here, anyway.)
                For this reason I am not prepared to formally comment on the
                features this project currently has or may have in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                As this a personal, independent project, there are currently no
                deadlines or guarantees or other such restrictions.
                This is basically a "spare time" project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all likelihood you might not see the complete project on
                GitHub.
                There may be whole sections which I might not see fit to post on
                GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of me hopes to finish this project and maybe pass this
                along to other jobseekers.
                Another part hopes that I find work soon enough so that I won't
                have to finish this -- except by popular demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                I began this project in May 2013. As I write this (August 2013),
                it remains too early for me to say whether this project may some
                day become an application for nearly every jobseeker to use.
                If this project does become big enough and popular enough, I
                would be open to monetizing. One of my conditions for doing so
                is that the potential direct users of this application -- the
                unemployed -- must not pay in order to use it.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now this project is in the form of a typical website.
                I am also willing -- but not promising -- to pursue creating a
                mobile version.
